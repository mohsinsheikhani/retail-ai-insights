# Phase 04 ‚Äì Product Recommendations with Amazon Personalize

This phase focuses on building an AI-powered recommendation engine that delivers personalized product suggestions based on user behavior.

Instead of limiting ourselves to basic ML experimentation, this step takes a production-ready approach using Amazon Personalize to generate real-time recommendations for customers‚Äîjust like Netflix or Amazon.

## üéØ Objective

Enable a recommendation system that:
- Learns from user interaction data (views, purchases, etc.)
- Uses Amazon Personalize to train and deploy a custom model
- Delivers recommendations through an API Gateway + Lambda integration
- Retrieves full product details from DynamoDB

---

## Architecture & Flow

1. Lambda queries Personalize with an `ITEM_ID`.
2. Personalize returns similar `ITEM_ID`'s
3. Lambda enriches results using DynamoDB
4. Response is returned via API Gateway
