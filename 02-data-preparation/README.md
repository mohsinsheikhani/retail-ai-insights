# Phase 02 ‚Äì Data Preparation

In this phase, we process raw event data into analytics- and AI-ready formats across **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** zones using AWS Glue. This step lays the foundation for our forecasting and recommendation workloads.

## üéØ Objective

Transform raw data into structured, enriched, and purpose-specific datasets ready for machine learning models and analytics workflows.

## Architecture & Flow

| Zone   | Purpose                                                 | Output Format |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Bronze | Raw streamed event data from Firehose                   | JSON          |
| Silver | Cleaned & validated data via Glue ETL                   | Parquet       |
| Gold   | Purpose-specific data for Forecasting & Recommendations | Parquet/CSV   |

## Buckets Created

| Bucket Purpose                | Description                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bronze Zone**               | Stores raw JSON data from Firehose                   |
| **Silver Zone**               | Receives cleaned, structured data                    |
| **Gold Zone**                 | Stores data tailored for forecasting/personalization |
| **Scripts & Datasets Bucket** | Hosts Glue ETL scripts and source data files         |

## Glue Jobs Overview

| Job Name                   | Function                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DataCleaningETLJob`       | Cleans Bronze data and writes structured output to Silver zone (Parquet)                                                  |
| `ForecastGoldETLJob`       | Aggregates daily sales, adds time-based features, writes to `forecast_ready/`                                             |
| `RecommendationGoldETLJob` | Extracts 4 required columns from the dataset and outputs a CSV for Amazon Personalize, writes to `recommendations_ready/` |

---

## Crawlers

| Crawler Name                 | Crawls Bucket Zone       | Creates Glue Table             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `DataCrawlerBronze`          | Raw Firehose data        | `bronze_retail_ai_bronze_data` |
| `DataCrawlerSilver`          | Cleaned Parquet output   | `silver_cleaned_data`          |
| `DataCrawlerForecast`        | Forecast-ready directory | `gold_forecast_ready`          |
| `DataCrawlerRecommendations` | CSV for Personalize      | `gold_recommendations_ready`   |

---

## Athena Queries (Example)

Once crawlers are run and tables are created, you can query them with Athena, to check sample data after cleaning:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data_db.bronze_retail_ai_bronze_data;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data_db.silver_cleaned_data;
```

![13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c2389a6-ec85-4894-b48a-9b645ba3ea3d)

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data_db.gold_forecast_ready;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data_db.gold_recommendations_ready;
```
