# Retail AI Insights: Demand Forecasting & Product Recommendations with AWS

This project builds a cloud-native, AI-powered retail intelligence system that predicts product demand and recommends items to users, all using serverless AWS services and scalable MLOps practices.

It is organized into 5 clear phases to demonstrate real-world infrastructure, AI integration, and automation.

---

## Project Objective

Retail businesses lose revenue due to:

- Overstocking or understocking inventory
- Missed cross-selling opportunities
- Manual forecasting processes that can‚Äôt scale

This solution uses **AWS Bedrock**, **Amazon Personalize**, and other cloud-native tools to:

- Forecast product demand based on sales patterns
- Recommend relevant products to users in real-time
- Maintain a scalable, automated, and secure backend

## How to Deploy

Each phase directory contains its own setup guide using AWS CDK and scripts.
Ensure:

- You have AWS credentials configured
- CDK is bootstrapped in your region
- Python and Node.js dependencies are installed
